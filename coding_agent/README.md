# AI Coding Agent (Conceptual Implementation)

This directory contains a conceptual Python implementation of an AI Coding Agent designed to integrate with a powerful language model like Gemma 3. The agent can understand user requests related to coding, interact with a file workspace, and leverage the language model for tasks like code generation, explanation, and debugging.

## Features (Conceptual)

*   **Code Generation**: Create code snippets or full scripts in supported languages.
*   **Code Explanation**: Describe what a piece of code does.
*   **Debugging Assistance**: Help identify issues in code (relies heavily on the LLM's capabilities).
*   **File Management**: Ability to read, add (and conceptually write) files in a managed workspace.
*   **Tool Usage**: Designed to leverage the LLM's function-calling ability to interact with "tools" (e.g., file system access, linters).

## Architecture

The agent is built with a modular architecture:

*   **`CodingAgent` (`agent.py`)**: The main orchestrator. It initializes all components and processes user messages.
*   **`InputProcessor` (`input_processor.py`)**: Handles initial parsing of user input, intent recognition (simplified), and conversation history management.
*   **`WorkspaceManager` (`workspace_manager.py`)**: Manages an in-memory representation of files the agent is working with.
*   **`ToolExecutionEngine` (`tool_executor.py`)**: Executes predefined tools (like reading/writing files). This component would be called by the LLM via its function-calling mechanism. It also provides schemas for available tools.
*   **`GemmaInteractionModule` (`gemma_interaction.py`)**: Responsible for communication with the (mocked) Gemma language model. It prepares prompts, sends queries, and processes responses, including handling requests for tool calls.
*   **`TaskOrchestrator` (`task_orchestrator.py`)**: Coordinates the steps to fulfill a user's request. It decides whether to query the LLM directly, whether a tool needs to be called first, and how to sequence operations.
*   **`OutputFormatter` (`output_formatter.py`)**: Formats the agent's final response for user presentation.

## How it Works (Conceptual Flow)

1.  A user sends a message (e.g., "Write a Python function to sum a list").
2.  The `InputProcessor` analyzes the message for intent and entities.
3.  The `CodingAgent` passes this to the `TaskOrchestrator`.
4.  The `TaskOrchestrator` prepares context (conversation history, workspace files) and queries the `GemmaInteractionModule`.
    *   It provides the LLM with schemas of available tools (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
5.  The `GemmaInteractionModule` (mock LLM):
    *   If it can answer directly, it provides content (e.g., generated code).
    *   If it needs to use a tool (e.g., to read a file before explaining it), it responds with a "tool call" request.
6.  If a tool call is requested:
    *   The `TaskOrchestrator` directs the `ToolExecutionEngine` to run the specified tool with the given arguments.
    *   The result from the tool is sent back to the `GemmaInteractionModule`, which makes a follow-up query to the LLM, providing the tool's output.
    *   The LLM then generates a response based on the tool's output.
7.  The final response from the LLM (or an error message) is formatted by the `OutputFormatter`.
8.  The `CodingAgent` returns the formatted response to the user and updates the conversation history.

## Usage Example (Illustrative Python Snippet)

```python
# This is how you might interact with the agent if it were fully implemented
# (This is based on the if __name__ == "__main__" block in agent.py)

# from coding_agent import CodingAgent # Assuming it's installed or in PYTHONPATH

# agent = CodingAgent(gemma_model_name="actual-gemma-model-endpoint") # In a real scenario

# Initialize the agent (using the mock from the example)
from agent import CodingAgent # If running directly from the directory
agent = CodingAgent()


# 1. Generate code
response = agent.process_message("Generate a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number.")
print(response)
# Expected: A Python function for factorial.

# 2. Add a file to the agent's workspace
response = agent.process_message("add file \"math_utils.py\" with content \"def add(a, b): return a + b\"")
print(response)
# Expected: Confirmation that the file was added.

# 3. Ask the agent to read and explain the file (demonstrates tool use)
response = agent.process_message("Read the file math_utils.py and explain what the 'add' function does.")
print(response)
# Expected: The agent uses the 'read_file' tool, then Gemma explains the function.

# 4. List files in the workspace
response = agent.process_message("What files are currently in the workspace?")
print(response)
# Expected: A list including "math_utils.py".
```

## Current Implementation Notes

*   **Mocked LLM**: `gemma_interaction.py` uses a very simple mock of the Gemma model. It responds based on keywords rather than actual AI processing.
*   **In-Memory Workspace**: `workspace_manager.py` keeps file content in memory. No actual file system writes occur unless explicitly implemented.
*   **Simplified Intent Recognition**: `input_processor.py` uses basic regex for intent detection. A production system would use more robust NLP.
*   **Basic Toolset**: Only a few tools (`read_file`, `add_file`, `list_files`) are implemented in `tool_executor.py`.

This conceptual model provides a foundation. To make it a production-ready agent, the `GemmaInteractionModule` would need to integrate with a real Gemma API, the `ToolExecutionEngine` would need robust security and potentially more tools, and error handling would need to be more comprehensive.
